> Welcome to my personnal page. I am Noah, a PhD student in Montpellier, in the [SMILE](https://www.lirmm.fr/equipes/smile/) team at the [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/).
> My current work focuses on the reasearch probkem of integrating specific reasoning approaches from artificial intelligence for the improvement of extraction processes. In particular, we want to use argumentation as a reasoning process to adress inconsistency and provide explanations/justifications. The use of preferences also helps solve conflicts between arguments, thus helping the task of handling inconsistency.
> The goal of my studies are to (1) compare existing works on the use of preferences in argumentation and adapt them to data mining problems, (2) develop efficient algorithms for extracting explainable and non-conflicting knowledge, (3) use multi-agent modeling and simulation techniques [6] to measure the efficiency and satisfiability of reasoning modes in preference-based argumentation.
