Welcome to my personal page.

My name is Noah, and I am a PhD student at the [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/). I also work as a teacher at [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/), more precisely in the [Computer science department](https://informatique-fds.edu.umontpellier.fr/) of the Faculty of Sciences.  

My PhD project focuses on data mining, argumentation and theoretical artificial intelligence methods.


I am also very involved in the student life, as the president of the [Hello World association](https://associationhelloworld.wordpress.com/) since 2022. I often join university events and promote the girls in informatics and sciences in general.
